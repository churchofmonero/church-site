We believe that Monero has the greatest potential to innovate our global financial system because it is the best form of money the world has ever seen.

## FIRST STEPS

In our quest to colonize the rest of the solar system, a Moon base is a critical prerequisite. The Moon contains the necessary mass to construct complex space structures.This [YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGcvv3683Os) explains the benefits of industrializing the Moon in more detail.

Before we can do that, we need to deploy a 3D printer to the Moon capable of using lunar regolith as material. Before we can do that, we plan to deploy a commercial satellite that will function as a Monero full node.

# Challenges

We plan to design self replicating robots that can be 3D printed with lunar regolith.

One of our biggest challenges will be sorting the lunar regolith into the various elements for direct metal laser sintering (DMLS). DMLS is the form of 3D printing that most efficiently utilizes the Moon's raw materials and solar exposure.

Ideally we develop or discover a method to sort lunar regolith without chemical agents brought from Earth.
